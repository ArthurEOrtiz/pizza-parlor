# Pizza Parlor

Create a website for a pizza company where a user can choose one or more individual toppings (cheese, pepperoni, artichoke, anchovy, etc) and a size to order a pizza and see the final cost.

 * Allow the user to choose toppings and size for the pizza they'd like to order.
 * Create a pizza object constructor with properties for toppings and size.
 * Create a prototype method for the cost of a pizza depending on the selections chosen. Use your own formula for this.
